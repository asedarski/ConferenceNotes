# Poetry (almost) from Scratch
## Yann Schwartz - Criteo
- Poetry is a mode of language
- The problem
    - Finding the stresses in the words
        - Manually encoded the words of the english language but this didn't seem to work
        - There are too many exceptions to reliably determine which form the poetry is in
        - So lets try machine learning
