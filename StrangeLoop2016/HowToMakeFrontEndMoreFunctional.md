# How to Make Front-End More Functional
## Julia Gao - OC Tanner
- Immutable Data
    - Can't change variables after assigning them
    - Problems with Mutable Data
        - No control over parameters and outputs
        - Can produce bugs
        - Not thread safe
        - No reference sharing
        - Easy to lose control when you change variables
    - Some languages have persistent data structures
    - No need to lock on multi-threaded operations
    - What about loops?
        - Loops encourage mutation
- Pure Functions
    - Same input, same output
    - Example - math functions
    - Benefits
        - Expected results
        - Easy to refactor
        - More organized codebase
        - Easier to onboard new employees
    - Javascript has a lot of pure functions
- Composable Functions
    - Ie. Functions inside of functions
- Types
    - The code cares about the types... even if you don't
- ImmutableJS
    - JS library to restrict mutation
    - ClojureScript
    - PureScript
