        - Infinite set
        - Type of data processing engine
    - Batch
        - Finite set
        - Type of executing engine
- How to choose an engine?
    - Latency
    - Accuracy
    - Cost
- Accurate bounded data processing
    - Reprocess the finite set again on failure
- Accurate unbounded data processing
    - Needs
        - Consistent state
            - Across failure via checkpointing
        - Tools/techniques to reason about time
- Triggers
    - When to compute and materialize window results
        - Before a window
        - At window completion
        - After window completion
- Watermark
    - Reasoning about completeness
    - Watermarks describe event time progress
    - Too slow -> events are delayed
    - Too fast -> some data is late
