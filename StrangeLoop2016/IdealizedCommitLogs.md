# Idealized Commit Logs
## Alan Shreve - NGROK
- Code is more often read instead of written
- We're taught to think about how to write code, not thinking in mind with the readability of the code
- Program comprehension is a subtask of debugging, fixing, developing...
- How do we understand Software then?
    - Documentation.... Maybe if you're lucky
    - Debugging
    - White board
    - Print statements
    - Read the Code
        - Expert programmers read code with a semantic processor in our brain
- So can we build mental models from code faster?
    - Small programs are easy to understand
    - Become difficult with edge cases, workarounds, features, error handling, etc.
    - How do we simplify programs so that it's easier to read?
        - Write test cases, run code coverage report, prune statements not covered, clean up and write the code back up
        - Following this method, the code compiles and the test cases pass - PROGRAM SLICING
- Program Slicing
    - Many different types
        - Forward Slicing
        - Dynamic Slicing
        - Thin Slicing
        - Observational Slicing
    - Static Slice
        - Do not execute the program - algorithm solely based on static observation
        - Behavior preserving
        - Remove as many unnecessary statements as possible
    - Dynamic Slice
        - Execute program and record information about how it's executing
- What can you do with it?
    - Better context
    - Good for maintenance tasks
    - Skip tests by knowing exactly what that piece of code touches
    - Reduce codebase size
    - Debugging gets easier
    - UNDERSTANDING/LEARNING
- Tools - Most work on C, maybe Java
    - Indus
    - Giri
    - Wala
    - Frama-C plugin
    - JSlice
    - CodeSurfer
- Idealized Commit Log
    - Run code coverage
    - Choose a best ordering for the test cases
    - Create slice for tests 0-N
    - Create Slice from 0-N+1
    - Diff the slices
