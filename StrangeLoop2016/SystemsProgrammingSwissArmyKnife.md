- Case of the missing config file
    - strace
        - strace -f -e open bash
        - Can make your program run much slower
    - System calls
        - socket
        - open
        - execve
        - sendto
        - read
        - recvfrom
        - write
    - opensnoop
        - fast
- The case of the slow program
    - Slow network process
        - find pid of the process
        - check the linux kernel stack for that process
    - Slow on CPU
    - dstat
        - How much disk, network, CPU are you using each second
    - top / htop / perf top
        - perf top
            - It can tell you which functions inside of programs are running slowly
- The case of the french website
    - Website is in one language sometimes and another sometimes else
    - ngrep
        - Shows network requests
- perf
    - In general, a performance analysis tool
    - FlameGraph.pl
