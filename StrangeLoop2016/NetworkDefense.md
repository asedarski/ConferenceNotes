# Diocletian, Constantine, Bedouin Sayings, and Network Defense
## Adam Wick - Galois, Inc.
- We think we should find the bottleneck, fix it, and then we'll be good
- Battle of Thermopylae
    - Trapped them at the choke point
    - Every API is one bad parse away from a big, big problem
    - Networks are porous, there's not just one choke point in our networks
- Defense in Depth
    - Firewall
    - Subnet defenses
    - Protect each host
    - Expensive and timely...
- Ancient Roman Empire, strategy worked if they had:
    - More money
    - More people
    - Better trained people
    - A technical edge
    - Eventually these things aren't true anymore
- Diocletian - Late roman approach
    - Decides it's too big of an empire, decides to appoint co-emperors (Constantine)
    - Problems
        - Not enough troops to hold border
        - Not enough troops to defend every city
    - Solutions
        - Build walls around the cities
        - Small but mobile army
    - Key aspects
        - Your border guard isn't there to defend against all attacks, mostly there to notify
        - Know about the attack as soon as possible
        - Hold key assets long enough for the calvary to get there
- Maybe we should adopt the late Roman approach
    - Intrusion detection
        - Takes way too long to detect intrusions
        - People think we should just keep out the intruders, but we need the protection on the other side just in case
    - Buy modest firewall
    - Protect your subnets with leftover money
    - Protect critical nodes, then other nodes, then upgrade firewall, then fortify subnets... etc
- Competition does not mean total war
    - We need to collaborate to protect ourselves and each other
- Things to remember
    - You probably don't know your borders
    - Spread the security across the system
    - You have friends in the world
