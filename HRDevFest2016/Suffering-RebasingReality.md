# Suffering: Rebasing Reality : Michael Rollins
## Michael Rollins - Flurry
- In a lot of ways going through suffering is like rebasing...
- As humans we naturally avoid suffering, but is this the right way?
    - Some of the greatest achievements have been made through suffering
- Paul shows us to embrace the suffering and that we should glory in it
- MLK Jr. in suffering there's a choice:
    - React with bitterness
    - Transform the suffering into a creative force
- Let's assume we've chosen to embrace suffering
- Tools for coping:
    - Laughter
        - Nothing shows a man's character more than what he laughs at
    - Family and community
        - People that can advocate and do for you when you can't
        - Suffering in isolation is hard
    - Faith
        - The belief that someone has your back is really powerful
        - The belief that all of this has a purpose is critical
    - Honesty
        - Really tell people how it is
        - Bitch... get it off your chest
    - Writing/Journaling/Social Media
        - Put your inner turmoil into words
        - Easier way to inform everyone around you
    - Work
        - Find something other than your suffering to focus on
    - Retreat
        - Sometimes you need to retreat for a day, or a few days
        - A time to shut it all off
    - Thankfulness
        - There's always something left to be thankful for
        - Starting to list what you're thankful for, that list quickly grows
        - Despair cannot conquer thankfulness
    - When there is nothing left to do, stand -Paul
        - Show you're not crushed... you're still standing and still moving
- Purpose
    - Giving your suffering a purpose makes it lose power over you
    - Find a way to help others through your suffering
    - Help yourself as well
        - Sometimes sharing your story helps you heal and can free you
- Once you go through it, there is change
    - Thriving exists on the other side of survival
    - You have new skills and a new perspective
    - You're now a different person
