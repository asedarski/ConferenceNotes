# Scale Your Node Application, Forget the Infrastructure - Getting the most out of AWS Lambda
## Matt Williams - DataDog
  - Lambda is
    - Serverless
    - Stateless
    - Trigger based
    - Your executable code
    - Without restrictions
    - Price based on execution time and memory
  - SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)/Microservices
    - One function - one purpose
  - Scalable Inputs and Outputs
    - Lambda is very scalable
  - Check if Data Exists
    - Stateless... BUT data could be there
    - Check in /tmp
  - Debugging
    - Use modules with Local Harness
    - All the logic should be in modules
    - The handler should be a minimal wrapper
    - AWS X-Ray for watching the processes
