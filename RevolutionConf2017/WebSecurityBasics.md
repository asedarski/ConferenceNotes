# Web Security Basics
## Eli White - One for All Events
  - These are things that are inherent to HTML and HTTP.. We all need to think about defend against it as web developers
  - [OWASP Resource](http://owasp.org/)
  - FIEO
    - Filter Input Escape Output
    - The #1 rule
    - Filtering
        - Not a direct security measure
        - Simplifies the security later (kinda ensures nothing really needs to be escaped later)
        - Provides security in depth
        - Makes for cleaner data
        - More layers of protection means less chance of exploit
        - Validate
            - Checking that the data is what was expected and if not, refuse it
            - Drawback - could be refusing data that could be figured out (ie phone number with dashes)
        - Sanitize
            - Attempt to convert data into an expected value
            - Drawback - accepting incorrect data
    - Escaping
        - Make the output safe to use
        - Each type of output must be appropriate for the context
  - SQL Injection
    - A user having the ability to send data that is directly interpreted by your SQL engine
    - Best way is to use prepared statements
        - A SQL query with placeholders where the variables will go
        - This prevents the SQL engine from actually interpreting the data as a SQL command
  - Other types of injections
    - Command injection
        - ie. Uploading a file that has an executable name that they just ran on your server
    - Unchecked file uploads
        - ie. uploading an executable file
    - Code injection
        - User being able to directly inject code
        - DON'T USE EVAL COMMAND
  - XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
    - User sending data that is executed as a script
    - Forms
    - User agent
    - Request headers
    - URL Strings
    - Reflected XSS
        - Directly echoing back content from the user
        - Solution - escaping characters
        - Chrome and safari have XSS Blockers but they're not reliable and only protect against simplest attacks
    - Stored XSS
        - Store the data in a database, and then later display it back
        - Allows an attack to live on your website
        - Solution - escape the output
    - DOM XSS
        - What happens in javaScript stays in javaScript
        - Solution - a library that encodes input/escape output
  - CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
    - A user having the ability to forge or force a request on the behalf of another user
    - Simplistically via IMG or POST forms
    - Solution - CSRF Tokens
        - Do we have the token, is it the one we expect, and has it not expired
        - Also have to make sure we have protected against XSS
  - Clickjacking
    - Tricks a user into physically making a click on the remote website without realizing it
    - Gets around CSRF protection
    - Somehow you have a button or a link that you've made people want to click
    - Putting an iframe of another website directly on top of the button that you drew, and making it opaque
    - Solution - X-Frame-Options header
        - Telling the browser whether or not the website should be allowed to render in an iframe
        - DENY
        - SAMEORIGIN
        - Not all older browsers support it
