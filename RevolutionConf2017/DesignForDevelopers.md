    1. Finding great colors
        - Stick to a simple palette
        - Pick a color, any color
        - Choose your shade
            - [Color helper](http://dribble.com/colors) - pick one and see it being used
        - Create a color palette
            - Only add a new color when you need it

    2. Choosing right fonts
        - Google web fonts
        - Choosing 2 typefaces is often easier than choosing 1 (headings vs. body)
        - Make the body font simple and easy to read
        - A good tip - serif vs sans-serif
        - Headings look for character and body look for clarity

        - Typography is more than just choosing a nice font
    3. Making sense of hierarchy
        - Define what you want people to do and in what order
        - Make navigation simple and don't add too much
        - Catch peoples attention
        - Differentiate sections clearly
    4. Coming up with layouts
        - Look at what kind of content you have, find similar websites and sketch some different layouts
        - [Modular scale](http://type-scale.com) - for deciding size of typography
        - Ideal character lenghth: 45-75 characters per line
        - Spacing and lack of spacing is a common problem
        - Pick one unit and multiply or divide to come up with spacing measurements
    5. Adding some 'polish'
        - Fixing any issues you still aren't happy with
