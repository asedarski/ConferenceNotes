# Playing With Pixels: Photorealistic 3D
## Hunter Loftis - Heroku
  - 1995 Toy Story was the first full feature movie created by computers
    - Before that was casper (the ghost was CGI) and Jurrasic Park
    - There were more PhDs working on the film than any other movie in history (Steve Jobs was on the project)
    - $30,000,000 to produce Toy Story
    - $364,000,00 made from the movie
    - The graphics of toy story was far beyond what was currently out at the time
    - It took an average of 3 hours to render a single frame on the fastest computer
    - The final cut took 800,000 hours to render (91 years)
    - They used 117 computers in parallel to render the movie
  - There are two different camps of 3D rendering
    - Graphics vs. Physics
    - Physics (pixar) uses the natural laws of light and things of the world to really show 3D
    - Grapics is like painting triangles
  - Monte Carlo Path Tracing
    - State of the art light simulation
    - The algorithm really is simple at its core
    - Characteristics  you get with Path Tracing
        - Specular highlights
        - Soft shadows
        - Reflections
        - Refractions
        - Caustics
        - Color bleeding
        - Depth of field
  - v0.0.1 -- Basically drew a circle
  - Rendering Equation
    - Path tracing is a solution to the rendering equation
  - Path tracing is based on a set of easily understood principles
  - What is light?
    - An electromagnetic wave
    - Ray (origin + direction)
    - Color (RGB)
    - When light hits something
        - It either reflects immediately OR
        - Refracts into the object
        - Metals do not refract
        - Non metals have different rules depending on the composition
        - Reflect - diffuse - transmit
        - Percentages of those three depend on angle and composition
  - How can we simulate light?
    - Path tracing the light source goes backwards (from the camera traces backwards to the light source)
    - Each time the light hits a point it loses a bit of energy
    - We can't predict how the light is going to bounce---- WE DON'T! The path tracer randomizes it
    - Monte carlo integration
        - Randomly choose a selection add them up and average them -- You'll probably get pretty close to the real answer
    - Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF)
        - Each material gets a different probablility for it to reflect, transmit or diffuse
        - Every company has a different method for calculating this probability
        - Reflect based on Schlick's formula for Fresnel
        - Transmit based on materials transparency
        - Diffuse whatever light is leftover
    - Trace - recursively shoot rays at objects
    - BSDF - reflect/refract light all over
    - Recursion depth
        - trace -> bsdf -> trace -> bsdf -> trace....
        - How to keep your path tracer unbiased
        - How to determine the optimal recursion depth
            - This one uses an algorithm called Russian Roulette
            - At every step in the trace, you have a random chance of killing the ray
            - At each step that chance is weighted by how much energy has been lost at that point
