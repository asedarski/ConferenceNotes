# Keynote: The Middleware Express
## Matthew Weier O'Phinney
- Legacy applications
    - You have a feature you want to add, you go to implement it and find a bug
    - Bug lists stack up
    - You don't write tests because it's hard to test
- "Version 1" Frameworks
    - Had some testing capabilities but still relied on a lot of globals
    - No longer even get security updates
- How do we bridge frameworks?
    - Port it? Then have to track bugs
    - Setup a bridge network? Too much overhead
- Framework upgrades bring about burnout
- Standards
    - PHP has standards
    - Composer
    - PHP-FIG (framework interoperability group)
        - PSR's
            - Mostly standards around interfaces
            - PSR-7
                - HTTP message interfaces
            - PSR-15
                - Request/Response handlers and middleware
- PHP makes request/responses hard
    - Have to look at super globals, but have to know the server setup, redirects, etc.
    - It shouldn't be that hard, it's just text
- PSR-7
    - Request/Response interfaces started appearing on their own
- Middleware
    - Borrowed/stolen from Node.js
    - `next` is a callable that points to the next part of the queue
    - PSR-15 sets out to standardize middleware
        - `RequestHandler` interface
            - Basic lambda middleware
        - Middleware takes a Request and a RequestHandler to return a response which could be a queue
    - The goal is to remove the need for frameworks as it pertains to requests/responses
    - Middleware commodotizes how web applications are built, but more than that, who can build them
