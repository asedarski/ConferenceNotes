- Benefits of git include not having to make multiple copies of a file
- _Distributed_ version control
    - You have various places where you can make your changes
    - Multiple repositories
    - Git
- Why use git?
    - Powerful
    - Common
    - Searchable
- Other Git Hosts
    - Gitlab
    - Bitbucket
    - Beanstalk
- Interfaces
    - Command line
    - Gui Apps
        - GitHub Desktop
        - Atlassian Sourcetree
        - Tower (Mac)
        - GitKraken
        - Most IDE's have a git management system
- Basic Commands
    - `git init`
        - creates a .git directory
    - `git add`
        - add a file to Git tracking
        - OR stage the changes for a future commit
    - `git commit`
        - keep in the repo what you did
        - `-a`
            - for adding all changed files
        - `-m`
            - for adding messages here in line
        - `--amend`
            - fixes last commit (changes the hash)
    - `git status`
        - learn the status of the repo at the current time
    - `git diff`
        - see line-level changes since last commit
    - `git log`
        - see all recent changes in reverse chronological order
        - `--stat`
            - file-level changes view
    - `git mv`
        - like `mv` but tracks the move
    - `git rm`
        - like `rm` but tracks deletion
    - `git rm --cached`
        - removes the file from Git but not the filesystem
- Working With Others
    - `git clone`
        - copy an existing Git repo and sets as your "origin"
    - `git push`
        - send your commits to the origin
    - `git pull`
        - fetch and merge in the current state of the origin
    - `git fetch`
        - copy history from origin but do not merge it
- Branching for Great Victory
    - `git branch`
        - list current branches
        - `git branch branchname`
            - creates but doesn't switch
        - default branch is called `master`
    - `git checkout`
        - `git checkout branchname`
            - puts you on a different branch
        - `git checkout -b branchname`
            - creates and checks out a branch
    - `git merge branchname`
        - pull contents of named branch into yours
        - merge conflicts happen when two things are unable to be automatically reconciled
            - most commonly best fixed manually
    - `git rebase`
        - change the diverging (root) commit of a branch
        - useful for long-lived branches (but controversial)
        - can be done as multi-stage CLI process or with text-editor via `git rebase -i`
        - [useful tutorial](https://dev.to/maxwell_dev/the-git-rebase-introduction-i-wish-id-had)
- Push Branches to Remote
    - `git push -u origin <branch>`
        - `-u` is short for `--set-upstream`
- Less Common but Useful Things
    - `git revert`
        - create commits to undo bad commits
        - does not _remove_ the bad commits
    - `git reset`
        - undo bad things (in your current working tree)
        - `--soft`
            - touches no files nor index
        - `--mixed`
            - sets index, not files
        - ` --hard`
            - revert all tracked files to initial state, doesn't touch untracked files
                - `git clean -df`
                    - removes untracked files
    - `.gitignore`
        - list of intentially unkept files
        - each line is a pattern (regex)
     - `.gitkeep`
        - informal standard to allow you to commit "empty" directory
        - like if you want logs in a certain place but never want to keep the logs inside it
    - Detached HEAD State
        - you're not on the tip of a known branch
    - HEAD Notation
        - `HEAD` is most recent commit
        - `HEAD^` == `HEAD~` -- `HEAD~1` is one commit ago
        - `HEAD^^` ~= `HEAD~2` is two commits ago (for linear history)
            - both go backward through history but respond differently to merges
        - `~` specifies generation, `^` specifies which parent (where there are many), so `HEAD~1^2` is the second parent of a generation ago
        - [Good explanation](http://www.paulboxley.com/blog/2011/06/git-caret-and-tilde)
    - `git stash`
        - clean current "dirty" working directory
        - itself a sort of mini virtual git repo
    - Squashing Commits Together
        - controversial topic
        - some believe in `git merge --squash`
        - can be done with `git reset --soft HEAD~4` followed by the squashing commit
        - `git rebase -i --autosquash` can also work
    - `git bisect`
        - a tool for testing to find the commit that broke a feature
        - `git bisect start` to initiate
    - `git blame`
        - quick way to see the creator of the most recent changes in a given file
        - useful to find out why/when
    - `git cherry-pick <HASH>`
        - pull over a commit to your current branch
    - `git grep`
        - search in the working tree for a string
        - useful if you don't want to look in untracked files
