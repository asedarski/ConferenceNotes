# How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Regular Expressions
## Jordi Boggiano - @seldaek
- lead maintainer of Composer
- Co-founder of packagist
- Regex began in 1956
- Regex Components
    - Pattern
    - Subject String
    - Matches
- Pattern Components
    - Characters
    - Metacharacters
        - ex. `.`
    - Escaping metacharacters
- Character classes
    - ex. `[abcd]`
    - With ranges
        - ex. `[a-d]`
        - `[A-z]+` includes some characters inbetween because ASCII
    - Negated classes
        - ex. `[^a-z]`
    - Escaping
        - ex. `[//^/]`
    - Match ASCII control characters
        - ex. `[\x00-\x1f]`
    - Matching unicode characters
        - ex. `[\x{25E6}-\x{25ef}]+`
- Character Class Shortcuts
    - Word Chars
        - `\w` = [A-Za-z0-9_]
        - `\W` = [^A-Za-z0-9_]
    - Whitespace Chars
        - `\s`
        - `\S`
    - Digits
        - `\d`
        - `\D`
- Dot Metacharacter
    - `.` = [^\n]
- Subpatterns and Alternations
    - ex. `bo(mb|ys)` = Stay on the __bomb__ run, __boys__!
    - Subpatterns can be named
        - `(?P<first>\w)\w+(?P<last>\w)`
    - Put most specific things first for matching alternations
        - `bobby|bob` instead of `bob|bobby`
- Quantifiers
    - Cope with uncertainty
    - ? = 0-1 times
    - * = 0+ times
    - + = 1+ times
    - {x, y} = between x-y times
    - Lazy matching
        - {x, y}?
        - It will only match a minimal amount
    - Possessive Quantifiers
        - Match and do not give up matches
        - ex. `trig++ger`
- Anchors
    - ^ beginning
    - $ end
    - With m modifier - the beginning and end of the lines
    - \A = absolute beginning of the string
    - \z = absolute end of the string
- Back-references to Subpatterns
    - `(['"])\w+\1` = avoids matching mixed quotes
- Lookahead & Lookbehind
    - Lets match words surrounded by *'s
    - `\*\w+\*` includes the *s
    - `(?<=\*)\w+(?=\*)` excludes the *s
    - `(?<!\*)\w+(?!\*)` - matches everything not surrounded by a * but causes issues for words inside matching some of the characters
    - `\b(?<!\*)\w+(?!\*)\b`
- Conditionals
    - Not recommended - better to use if/elseif within code
- Pattern Delimiters
    - You can use // or {}
- Modifiers
    - `i` = case insensitive
    - `m` = multiline
    - `s` = single line
    - `u` = unicode
    - `D` = Dollar end only
    - `x` = free-spacing mode (good for comments)
- Regex Engines
    - First match wins
    - An overall match is always preferred to a non-match
    - The engine backtracks to the last match encountered when no match is found
