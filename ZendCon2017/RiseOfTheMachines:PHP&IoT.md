# Rise of the Machines: PHP & IoT
## Colin O'Dell - @colinodell
- Interet of Things
- We can run PHP on devices, the cloud, on a server
- DIY IoT Devices
    - Raspberry Pi
        - Because it has to run an OS, you don't have direct access to the pins
    - Arduino
        - Code in C
        - No OS
        - No built in internet connectivity
    - How to choose?
        - Identify required features
        - Ideal programming language
        - Consider power requirements
        - Size/footprint
- Four Examples Using PHP
    - Uptime Monitor
        - Use Pi to monitor if site is up
        - Uses an LED to indicate
        - Use resistors for LEDs because they can only handle so much power
        - PiPHP: GPIO
            - Library for low level access to the GPIO pins
            - Used to control outputs (LEDs, motors, valves, pumps) or read inputs (sensors)
    - Conference Room Occupancy Sensor
        - Detects movement in the room, sends room status to Slack
        - PIR Sensor: motion sensor
        - PHP GPIO - Input Signal Interrupts
        - Signal tells when motion is detected but can't just send when each motion event occurs
        - `ColinODell\PHPIoTExamples\PHPPIRSensor` - class for movement tracking
    - Alexa Custom Skill
        - PHP + Laravel to handle request for ZendCon session information
    - Packagist Download Counter
        - Display download counts from the Packagist API with Particle Photon
        - Particle Photon
            - WiFi built in
            - OTA Flashing
            - Built in webhook support
        - JSON document from Packagist is too big
            - Yahoo YQL - but this was down too often
            - Created a JSON parser to just get the count
        - Must have a `setup` function and a `loop` function
        - `setup`
            - shutdown - wakes up the device
            - subscribe to webhook
        - `loop`
            - fetch updates
            - set the digits
            - publish
